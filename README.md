Capistrano::Rsync for Capistrano v3
===================================
[![Gem version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/capistrano-rsync.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/capistrano-rsync)

Deploy with Rsync to your server from any local (or remote) repository.  
Saves you from having to install Git on your production machine and allows you to customize which files you want to deploy.

Works with the new [**Capistrano v3**](http://www.capistranorb.com/) and is suitable for deploying any apps, be it Ruby or Node.js.  
Currently works **only with Git** (as does Capistrano v3), so please shout out your interest in other SCMs.


Using
-----
Install with:
```
gem install capistrano-rsync
```

Require it at the top of your `Capfile`:
```ruby
require "capistrano/setup"
require "capistrano/deploy"
require "capistrano/rsync"
```

Set some `rsync_options` to your liking:
```ruby
set :rsync_options, %w[--recursive --delete --delete-excluded --exclude .git*]
```

And after setting regular Capistrano options, deploy as usual!
```
cap deploy
```

### How does it work?
Capistrano::Rsync clones your repository to `tmp/cache` on your local machine, checks out the branch set in the `branch` variable (`master` by default) and then Rsyncs that directory to your servers.

### Excluding files from being deployed
If you don't want to deploy everything you've committed to your repository, pass some `--exclude` options to Rsync:
```ruby
set :rsync_options, %w[
  --recursive --delete --delete-excluded
  --exclude .git*
  --exclude /config/database.yml
  --exclude /test/***
]
```
